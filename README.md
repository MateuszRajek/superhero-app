# superhero-app
react.js app created using superhero api from https://superheroapi.com/

There is an api token required for this app. *!!!The Landing Page with token field does not work properly and needs to be fixed.!!!* It can be taken from https://superheroapi.com/ (needs a facebook account to generate token). 
If you are a recruiter the token has been sent via email together with my application.

!!! The Landing Page with token field does not work properly and needs to be fixed. !!!

You can search for your favourite hero by typing the name of some "key word". 
### Example: if you want to find a Superman - type 'super'
